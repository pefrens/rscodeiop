## Installation

You can install the development version of `rscodeiop` from [GitHub](https://github.com/pefrens/rscodeiop) with:

```r
# Using pak (recommended)
pak::pak("pefrens/rscodeiop")

# Or using remotes
# install.packages("remotes")
# remotes::install_github("pefrens/rscodeiop")
```

## Prerequisites

- **RStudio 1.2.0 or higher** (required for theme support)
- **Administrator privileges** for menu theme installation (Windows/Linux only)

### Important Note About Permissions

`rscodeiop` modifies RStudio's menu themes by updating style sheets in the RStudio installation directory. This requires administrator privileges:

**Windows:**
- Right-click on RStudio shortcut or menu icon
- Select **"Run as Administrator"**

**Linux:**
- Start RStudio from terminal: `sudo rstudio --no-sandbox`

**macOS:**
- No administrator privileges required
- Menu theming is not supported (inherits from macOS system theme)

## Quick Start

### Basic Installation

```r
# Install theme with menu styling (requires admin privileges)
rscodeiop::install_theme()

# Install theme without menu styling (no admin privileges needed)
rscodeiop::install_theme(menus = FALSE)
```

### Check Installation Status

```r
# Get detailed status information
rscodeiop::print_theme_status()

# Check if theme is installed
rscodeiop::rscodeio_installed()

# Check if menu theme is active
rscodeiop::is_menu_theme_active()
```

## Advanced Usage

### Force Reinstallation

```r
# Reinstall even if already present
rscodeiop::install_theme(force = TRUE)
```

### Menu Theme Management

```r
# Activate menu theme separately
rscodeiop::activate_menu_theme()

# Deactivate menu theme (restores original RStudio menus)
rscodeiop::deactivate_menu_theme()

# Silent operations (no console messages)
rscodeiop::activate_menu_theme(silent = TRUE)
rscodeiop::deactivate_menu_theme(silent = TRUE)
```

### Complete Uninstallation

```r
# Remove all rscodeiop themes and restore original menus
rscodeiop::uninstall_theme()
```

## Recommended RStudio Settings

For the best visual experience, enable these RStudio settings:

1. **Tools** → **Global Options…** → **Code** → **Display**:
   - ☑ **Highlight selected line**
   - ☑ **Show indent guides**

   - ☑ **Highlight R function calls**

2. **Tools** → **Global Options…** → **Appearance**:
   - Select **rscodeiop** or **tomorrow night bright (rscodeio)** theme

## Theme Management

### Switching Themes

The menu theme persists even when switching to other RStudio themes. To manage this:

```r
# Before switching to another theme, deactivate menu theme
rscodeiop::deactivate_menu_theme()

# Switch to desired theme in RStudio UI
# Tools → Global Options → Appearance → Editor theme

# Reactivate rscodeiop menu theme if desired
rscodeiop::activate_menu_theme()
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

```r
# Check current status
rscodeiop::print_theme_status()

# Force clean reinstall
rscodeiop::uninstall_theme()
rscodeiop::install_theme(force = TRUE)

# Install without menu themes if permission issues persist
